### Libraries
1. **Matplotlib**
   - **Description:** Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a MATLAB-like interface for plotting data.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Basic plotting functions (line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, etc.)
     - Extensive customization options for visual elements
     - Support for various output formats (PNG, PDF, SVG)
2. **Seaborn**
   - **Description:** Seaborn is a high-level statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a more convenient interface for creating complex visualizations and includes beautiful default styles.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Built-in themes and color palettes for aesthetically pleasing plots
     - Functions for creating complex plots with simpler syntax (e.g., pair plots, heatmaps)
     - Integration with Pandas DataFrames for easy data manipulation and plotting

### Dataset

**Iris Dataset**
- **Description:** The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers, with 150 samples across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- **Features:**
  - **Sepal Length (cm):** Length of the sepal.
  - **Sepal Width (cm):** Width of the sepal.
  - **Petal Length (cm):** Length of the petal.
  - **Petal Width (cm):** Width of the petal.
  - **Species:** The species of the iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
- **Source:** The dataset is available through `sklearn.datasets` and `seaborn`.

  ```python
  from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
  iris = load_iris()
  ```

  or

  ```python
  import seaborn as sns
  df = sns.load_dataset('iris')
  ```

## Setup and Installation

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy
```

To use Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
pip install notebook
```
## Visualizations

Here’s a detailed explanation of each type of visualization used in this project:

# Pair Plot

**Theory:** A pair plot (or scatterplot matrix) visualizes pairwise relationships between features in a dataset. It displays scatter plots for each pair of features and histograms for each individual feature along the diagonal. This helps to identify correlations, distributions, and patterns between features.

- **Usage:** Useful for understanding how features relate to each other and identifying clusters or trends in data.
### Histogram

**Theory:** A histogram represents the distribution of a single variable by dividing the data into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin. It provides insight into the frequency distribution of the data, helping to identify patterns such as skewness, bimodality, or outliers.

- **Usage:** Useful for visualizing the distribution and spread of a single feature, and for understanding the underlying distribution of the data.

### Box Plot

**Theory:** A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) summarizes the distribution of a dataset through quartiles. It displays the median, upper and lower quartiles, and potential outliers. This helps to visualize the spread and identify any deviations or outliers in the data.

- **Usage:** Useful for comparing the distribution of a feature across different categories (e.g., species) and identifying outliers.
- 
### Scatter Plot

**Theory:** A scatter plot displays the relationship between two continuous variables. Each point represents an observation in the dataset, and points are often colored or shaped by a categorical variable. This helps to visualize correlations, trends, and relationships between variables.

- **Usage:** Useful for identifying relationships between two features and understanding how different categories are distributed.

### Heatmap

**Theory:** A heatmap represents data in a matrix format, where individual values are shown as colors. In the context of feature correlation, it visualizes the correlation matrix, which shows how features are correlated with each other. The color intensity represents the strength of the correlation.

- **Usage:** Useful for identifying correlations between features and understanding the strength and direction of relationships in the dataset.
